# Sandcastle Modeling

In an effort to conclude which three-dimensional shapes last the longest as a sandcastle base, we visualize myriad shapes on a three-dimensional grid. We break down each shape into smaller three-dimensional cells, each with a wetness parameter. Within each cell, its wetness parameter increases as it is subjected to more contact with waves. We conclude that a base is “destroyed” when 50 percent of its volume has been eroded.

In our model, we select five shapes as candidates for a base: rectangular prism, cylinder, rhombus, ellipsoid, and pyramid. We run two simulations - one in which the shapes are only subjected to waves (with the tides), while the other simulation includes the addition of rainfall. By simulating the wave velocities and heights at each time step, factoring the impact of the tides on change in wave velocity, we apply wetness damage to each of the cells accordingly. In the waves-only simulation, the ellipsoid comes out as the optimal shape, taking the longest amount of time to reach 50 percent destruction by volume. 

After conducting some research on the time scales and physics of raindrops, we were also able to implement a rain simulation where raindrops hit each cell on the top layer of a base at a consistent interval. Again, the ellipsoid-shaped base endured the longest amount of time, before succumbing to the erosion forces of the rainfall and waves.
